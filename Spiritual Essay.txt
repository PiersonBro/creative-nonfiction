					Behold thy son
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.
John 19: 25-27 (KJV)
	
	I had been hoping to have a conversation with James one on one, since I first met him in his home just outside of Strasbourg a year ago. James has a wiry frame with a mop of curly hair and a prominent nose. Combine his overall look with glasses and he has a distinctively absent-minded, mid-century-professor look. I also had an agenda. I knew James was capable of handling spiritually complexity and hurt because I knew that he, an evangelical American, had somehow learned how to do divinity school at a seminary where some of the faculty didn’t even believe in God. I also knew that he was no stranger to the complexity of faith and relationships. In short, even though I barely knew James I valued his opinion a bit like family.
So when James struck up conversation with me by asking something politely anodyne; I saw and sized my opportunity. Words started pouring from my mouth that I had never uttered before.
					*****************************
In El Cajon, across from Gillespie Field (a small airport), is Foothills community church. What was once a two story office space in the 1990s has transformed into a much larger concrete box of a building that is primarily one room—a massive auditorium capable of seating about a thousand people. Across a small courtyard is the youth building, which consists of a coffee bar, a gym, several class rooms and three larger spaces for children’s church every Sunday. These two buildings are surrounded on three sides by an asphalt sea of parking spaces (which church growth experts tell them is not enough). Beyond the surrounding asphalt, Foothills is surrounded by offices, storage spaces, and small businesses. It is an industrial area—there are no single story dwellings or apartments in sight. 
When I was just about to turn eleven, my family suddenly found itself looking for a new Church. It didn’t happen instantly, but we fell in with Foothills, which was a little less than 15 minutes away from us. After a period of great struggle spiritually, it was a time of tremendous life, particularly for my Mom whose theology closely matched the mission of the church: to love youth, to love God through worship, and to practice prayer. It’s no surprise the that their signature event was Future Quest. Which was a youth conference held at their church campus with lots of worship, prayer, and a swarm of high schoolers and middle schoolers.
For the entirety of my time at Foothills, Bill Wilson was the keynote speaker at Future Quest. While Thursday and Friday would always feature a different mix of speakers, Saturday’s were always the same: he got both the morning and the evening session of the last day. Bill Wilson is intense. His face is gaunt. His gray hair falls limply around his face. His voice is horse and raspy, not unlike a shady drug dealer in a fear-mongering anti-drug ad from the 90s. And I seem to remember a visible scar somewhere on his face. Or maybe I’m just conflating that with the time he got shot.

The defining moment of Bill Wilson’s life came when his mother abandoned him on a street corner at the age of twelve. Three days later, a Christian mechanic picked him up and sent him to a church camp where he gave his life to Jesus. The rest is history. He became a pastor, started several massive Sunday school programs and travels the world raising money from churches talking about his ministry. But he never let himself forget his story—Bill Wilson once spent the entirety of Christmas Eve on the sidewalk where his mother abandoned him.

All of Saturday morning consisted of Bill Wilson preaching from some biblical text that functioned as a thin wrapping around his origin story. His speaking style matched the intensity of his background. He was not afraid to say what he wanted to say. Even if that meant insulting his audience or shocking them by talking about something not safe for Church. He once called a minor celebrity a whore. He would make his fingers come to a point and bang his now beaklike hand against his brow while calling a member of society or the audience “ya pinhead”. The audience ate up Bill Wilson’s tough guy, street smart persona. I ate it up. 

That night was different. 
Bill Wilson was preaching from John 19:25-27. The passage details a little-known scene in the passion narrative in which Jesus, as he’s dying on the cross, tells Mary that John is her son: “Woman, behold thy son”. He then tells John Mary is his mother: “Behold thy mother”. That was the first time I heard this passage, so I was excited to hear a compelling interpretation.
Drawing on the fact that Jesus dies shortly after this scene Bill Wilson argued: “Before he could die on the cross, Jesus had to give up his own mother”. Which stuck with me. Especially because the idea that Jesus had to give up his desires in order to be obedient to the Father made sense to me. Then Bill started describing his prized possession—a motorcycle that he gave up to enter into ministry. Total abandon. Bill Wilson asked us to totally abandon something so that we could be fully devoted to God like he was. 
My heart was pounding. I was amped up. 
The need to respond to God was thick around and inside of me.
So I went down to the alter grabbed a piece of paper and scrawled “Technology” on it.
Then, with hundreds of peers around me, I placed the piece of paper on the alter. As the 
worship team started to play, I started to cry. 

A college aged man suddenly appeared to me and with tears streaming down my face I said “I surrendered!”
The man responded like he had been told he just won a million bucks. He began to pray for me.
“Thank you lord that Ezekiel has just surrendered his life to you”
“Wait, I didn’t just surrender my life to Jesus. I did that a long time ago, didn’t I?” I thought.
But the man was so happy and I was still crying too hard so the clarifying words died on my tongue, unsaid. Perhaps it was at that moment I decided I wouldn’t tell my family in detail about what had happened that night.

As we waited to be picked up that Saturday night, I did tell my twin brother and my sister what I wrote on the sheet of paper that I placed on the alter. But Zakris refused to tell me what he had written on his sheet of paper. If I had any remaining inclination of telling my parents what I had written on the sheet of paper it died during that short interaction. 
The prayer interaction with the college kid was never even a consideration because I was scared by the implication that I had’t been a christian until that night. At the same time I wanted to maintain the spiritual high that came from that night. I wanted to keep the catharsis of letting go, even if that thing I was letting go didn’t seem particularly prone to evil. I thought I could have it both ways if I just kept the experience to myself.
 				*****************************
But bargaining too began that night. I was amazed at what I had promised my God. I spent the next months and years trying to figure out a way to pursue my love of technology while still totally abandoning it. If it sounds contradictory that’s because it is. I wasn’t about to become a luddite, so obviously there was some interpretive task for me to do to determine what my vow entailed.
“It just means not browsing 9to5Mac or DaringFireball” I tried to convince myself. “Twitter though, is fine.”
It was exhausting. 
In the end, I just did what I wanted with technology and felt guilty about it.
					*****************************
It seemed like James took his time replying but he actually responded at a normal conversational pace.
“Have you ever considered that giving technology to God just means that it’s consecrated for him?”
I paused for a beat.
“No”
In the moment I couldn’t really explain why I hadn’t ever considered that as an option.

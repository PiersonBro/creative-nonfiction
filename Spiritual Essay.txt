					Null and Void

I was exhausted. It was just after nine o’clock but I had been fighting sleep for the last half hour. Barely conscious, I stumbled up to my room and promptly fell asleep. 
I awoke to a ringing FaceTime call. The internet connection was terrible. I accepted the call to my sister’s face— a pixelated mass of enthusiastic movement—she was hustling down the stairs.
“Get down here! We’re headed to the pub.” She excitedly instructed me. My sister had promised me we would grab a beer or two while in the Czech Republic and I wasn’t about to let a thing like sleep prevent me from taking her up on the offer. This time though, we’d be joining a group of missionaries.
The walk to the pub was short. Exit the monastery’s primary entrance, walk across the courtyard into and out the gravel parking lot. Then stroll three-quarters of the way down the asphalt slope.
We walked into a narrow hallway that fed into the bar area and immediately I felt uncomfortable. I was relieved when we navigated past the bar and into a patio area dotted with picnic tables complete with umbrellas. Around two of the tables were about fifteen of our group. Lydia saw an open seat next to the only two women in the group and snagged it. 
That left me to grab a seat. I sat down across from Micah, a football coach for the Prague Lions, and next to James, an ordained pastor in the French Reformed Church (not an easy feat for an American).
I had been hoping to have a conversation with James one on one, since I first met him in his home just outside of Strasbourg a year ago. James has a wiry frame with a mop of curly hair and a prominent nose. Combine his overall look with glasses and he has a distinctively absent-minded intellectual look. I knew James was capable of handling spiritually complexity and hurt because I knew that he, an evangelical American, had somehow learned how to do divinity school at a seminary where some of the faculty didn’t even believe in God. I also knew that he was no stranger to the complexity of faith and relationships. In short even though I barely knew James I valued his opinion a bit like family.
When the server came by, Micah quickly ordered a beer for me and another one for himself and James. Micah then resumed telling his tale of remarkable success as the best O-Line coach in the Czech Republic while simultaneously dealing with the painful ongoing fallout of a breakup that left him alienated from his church and consequently isolated from his broader Christian community. I listened. I was also anxious about my alcohol intake so I kept track of how fast the other men were drinking their beers—careful to go as slow or slower than they were. 
The beer was about half full by the time the conversation with Micah had run its course. James struck up conversation with me by asking something politely anodyne but I saw and sized my opportunity. Words started pouring from my mouth that I had never uttered before.

When I was just about to turn eleven, my family suddenly found itself looking for a new Church. It didn’t happen instantly, but we fell in with Foothills Community Church, a small megachurch in El Cajon about 10 minutes away from us. After a period of great struggle spiritually, it was a time of tremendous life, particularly for my Mom whose theology closely matched the mission of the church: to love youth, to love God through worship, and to practice prayer. It’s no surprise that their signature event, then, was Future Quest, a youth conference held at their church campus with lots of worship, prayer, and a swarm of high schoolers and middle schoolers.

For the entirety of my time at Foothills, Bill Wilson was the keynote speaker at Future Quest, so he got both the morning and the evening session of the last day. Bill Wilson is intense. His face is gaunt. His gray hair falls limply around his face. His voice is horse and raspy, not unlike a shady drug dealing in a fear-mongering anti drugs ad from the 90s. And I seem to remember a visible scar somewhere on his face. (Or maybe I’m just conflating that with the time he got shot?) 
The defining moment of Bill Wilson’s life came when his mother abandoned him on a street corner at the age of twelve. Three days later, a Christian mechanic picked him up and sent him to a church camp where he gave his life to Jesus. The rest is history. He became a pastor, started several massive Sunday school programs and travels the world raising money from churches talking about his ministry. But he never let himself forget his story—Bill Wilson once spent the entirety of Christmas Eve on the sidewalk where his mother abandoned him.


All of Saturday morning consisted of Bill Wilson preaching from a random Biblical text (what pastor doesn’t teach from the text?) that functioned as a thin wrapping around his origin story and a few random comments about modern culture. There were also a few “ya pinhead” comments thrown in there for extra emphasis. The audience ate it up. I ate it up. 

That night was different. 
Bill Wilson was actually preaching from John 19:25-27. The passage details a little-known scene in the passion narrative in which Jesus, as he’s dying on the cross, gives John as a son to his mother and vice-versa gives her to John as John’s mother. That was the first time I heard this passage, so I was excited to hear a compelling interpretation.
“Before he could die on the cross, Jesus had to give up his own mother”
Then Bill started describing his prized possession—a motorcycle that he gave up to enter into ministry. Total abandon. Bill Wilson asked us to totally abandon something so that we could be fully devoted to God like he was. 
My heart was pounding. I was amped up. 
The need to respond to God was thick around and inside of me.
So I went down to the alter grabbed a piece of paper and scrawled “Technology” on it.
Then, with hundreds of peers around me, I placed the piece of paper on the alter. As the 
worship team started to play, I started to cry. 

A college aged man suddenly appeared to me and with tears streaming down my face I said “I surrendered!”
The man responded like he had been told he just won a million bucks. He began to pray for me.
“Thank you lord that Ezekiel has just surrendered his life to you”
“Wait I didn’t just surrender my life to Jesus, I did that a long time ago, didn’t I” I thought.
But the man was so happy and I was still crying too hard so communicating such a clarifying died on my tongue, unsaid. Perhaps it was at that moment I decided I wouldn’t tell my family in detail about what had happened that night.
					*****************************
The beer was gone now. I had been taking constant sips while I told James a small portion of what happened that Saturday night almost eight years ago.
It seemed like James took his time replying but he actually responded at a normal conversational pace.
“Have you ever considered that giving technology to God just means that it’s consecrated for him?”
I paused for a beat.
“No”
In the moment I couldn’t really explain why I hadn’t ever considered that as an option.

					*****************************

That Saturday night the bargaining began. I was amazed at what I had promised my God. I spent the next months and years trying to figure out a way to pursue my love of technology while still totally abandoning it. If it sounds contradictory that’s because it is. I wasn’t about to become a luddite, so obviously there was some interpretive task for me to do to determine what my vow entailed.
“It just means not browsing 9to5Mac or DaringFireball” I tried to convince myself. “Twitter though, is fine.”
It was exhausting. 
In the end, I just did what I wanted with technology and felt guilty about it.
The vow was, in effect, null and void.
I am a weaker Jepthah.

I am sitting on the ground.
I am free of anxiety and happy.
It is no surprise that I am reading.
I am nine or ten years old and I had found this book, The Girl Who Could Fly, at the Fletcher Hills county library.
I had just checked it out of the library with my own library card. 
The first time Piper jumped off of her house, plummeted towards the earth, and abruptly leveled out my heart leaped.
In case you didn’t already know, I am enjoying this book. 
I hadn’t questioned the woman in a suit, who for some unfathomable reason seemed to be like me, when she abruptly showed up to take Piper to a special school. “The protagonist is always leaving home” I thought so it made perfect sense to me that Piper would too. Piper had just met an array of kids at the school, all with some power of their own. One of those was Bella.

Bella danced in my mind’s eye setting off rainbow after rainbow of pure beauty. But tears were streaming down her face. She wouldn’t be able to use her powers ever again.

My heart twisted in confused grief. I got up. I don’t want to continue reading, but I am like a satellite--only capable of avoiding a fiery fall into the earth’s atmosphere by speeding through the book.

These memories are so well worn. They seem more constructed than remembered. 

Things get worse. Still agitated, I moved the book to the filing cabinet.
Now I was standing as I read, literally pouring over the book.

I see Piper struggling to fly through a suddenly cramped and oppressive hallway.

My pride at finding a book I loved quickly turning to horror, I rip myself away from the book, and start to walk in a stressed and aimless way throughout my house.
The pacing did nothing—I was still bound to the The Girl Who Could Fly. I returned to the cheap wooden filing cabinet where I had placed the book. 
With my body protesting sharply I continued to read.
The school administrators are well and truly *evil* I felt more than I consciously thought.
How could they gather children only to destroy who they are?
My fascination and tolerance for the book finally broke. 
I didn’t know how to approach the extreme emotion of that moment. So I bottled it up. Like a lode of gold jaggedly delves into the core of the earth, my tumultuous experience shot through my heart.

Until I read The Girl Who Could Fly I had never dropped a book in the middle of reading it.
I resolved to never trust myself with picking out a book for myself—I would rely primarily on my sisters recommendation from now on.
For many years, I worked hard to ignore this experience. 
My brain quietly set up a no fly zone and quarantined this story off from everyone, but most importantly from myself. 

Several years later—It must’ve been at least two years but it felt like five—I walked back into my fletcher hills library and wandered over to the children’s section. Why I’m not quite sure, at this point I was reading more from the YA and Sci-Fi/Epic Fantasy shelves at the other end of the library. Standing all alone in the middle of a bookshelf was The Girl Who Could Fly. 
The no fly zone was readying its anti-aircraft weapons, but I still found myself lifting it off of its book rack—skipping over the words that had caused such agony to find the epilogue.
Piper and the rest of the gang are happy and thriving with their powers fully accepted in their respective communities. 
But Bella was nowhere to be seen.
Years later I would conclude Bella was Gay.
A few years after that I realized this story was about Conversion therapy.
